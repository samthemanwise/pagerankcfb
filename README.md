Using PageRank in R to rank college football teams objectively

- One of my first independent projects back in January 2023
- Wanted to find unique objective ranking method for College Football Rankings to replace sujective AP rankings
- Applied past Google search algorithm PageRank to season-long win/loss data
- Ranked teams based on PageRank scores at end of season
- Results/disucssion found in .html and markdown file
- Applied same method to College Basketball for March Madness for curiosity
- Data from cfbfastR and hoopR
